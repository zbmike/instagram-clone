# Instagram-Clone 
##### Following tutorial on youtube https://youtu.be/mDgEqoQUBgk, thanks Karl Hadwen

This project is to get into tailwind css which is a cool and awesome package to do css styling. I did some refactors and added minor feature myself. Firebase is awesome as well. It really simplifies the backend when one want to focus on the frontend.

This clone looks pretty good for a 2-day project. Unfortunately it does not have photo upload functions. I might come back to it to make it fully functional but it will happen later.
